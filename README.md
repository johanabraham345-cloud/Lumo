LUMO is an inclusive, AI-powered robotic learning assistant designed to support children with learning disabilities through engaging, multi-sensory experiences. Built on a Raspberry Pi platform, LUMO integrates a camera-guided robotic arm, an interactive screen module, and artificial intelligence to create a hands-on learning environment that adapts to each learner’s needs.

The system helps develop foundational skills such as colour recognition, basic mathematics, language development, and emotional literacy through voice-based interaction, visual object recognition, and adaptive questioning. The robotic arm responds to spoken commands, identifies and sorts objects using camera input, and performs physical actions that reinforce learning concepts. At the same time, the interactive screen provides visual feedback, stories, quizzes, and emotion-based cues to maintain attention and encourage active participation.

LUMO is designed as a supportive learning aid rather than a replacement for teachers, therapists, or parents. It helps sustain learner engagement during moments when individual attention may be limited, while still working alongside traditional teaching methods. The system is modular, customisable, and built using affordable hardware and 3D-printed components, making it suitable for use in classrooms, therapy centres, and home learning environments. Through its empathetic and interactive design, LUMO aims to make education more accessible, engaging, and inclusive for diverse learners.
